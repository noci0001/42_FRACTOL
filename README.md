***42 FRACTOL***

## SUMMARY

This project is meant to create graphically beautiful and mathematically interesting fractals.
It can also generate 3D point clouds stacking images of the sets. The aforementionned fractal sets are generated by iterating the function: **Z(n+1) = [Z(n)]^2 + C**, where Z and C are both complex nummbers.
Mandelbrot is generated by setting Z0 = 0+0i and each pixel corresponds to a different value of C. On the other hand, the Julia sets are generated by setting a different C for each set and a different Z0 for each pixel.

    IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:
     - It is possible to move the fractal (left, right, up, down);
     - Zoom (mouse wheel or mouse buttons);
     - Changing the depth (so u can see additional color spectrum at each particular section of the fractal);
     - Reset when researching of fractal went too far;
     - Several variants of color representation are chosen;
     - You can change the Julia's coefficients with your mouse, and plunge into the interactive psychedelic of this fractal for a long time;
     - 3D representation;

## RUN ON YOUR MACHINE

    1. Download go_FRACTOL folder;
    2. Run ./fractol  and you will see the list of available fractals;
    3. Run ./fractol fractal_name (ex: ./fractol mandelbrot_set);
    4. Follow the legend that you will see in your terminal window.

In this project I used an image approach for drawing, but multithreading is not implemented, therefore at large values â€‹â€‹of height and width of the screen the program will work slowly.
